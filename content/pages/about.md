# Purpose of this blog

I often come across interesting technological things that I quickly go through. And as soon as I
have understood it and got a grasp on how it roughly works, I put it aside again.

Fast forward to a few weeks later: My brain has decided to severe most of the connections and
links, so I can consider myself lucky if I still can remember what I have to
[duckduck](duckduckgo.com) to roughly figure out what this cloudy something that remotely
resembles a memory was about.

So in order to tackle this, I decided to create this blog. Mostly for my future self
(greetings, say hi to **future future self** from me), but maybe some people out there might also be
interested in the things I ramble about from time to time.

# Name

The name is an alliteration of my Nickname **[Pantos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%80%E1%BE%B6%CF%82)**
and the word **[Periphrasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periphrasis)**, which describes this
blog's future content in a [slightly ironic but probably accurate way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumlocution):
> [...] Periphrasis [...] is the use of an unnecessarily large number of words to express an idea.
